## WHAT IS A/B TESTING?
A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to a randomized experimentation process where two or more versions of a variable (web page, page element, etc.) are shown to different segments of website visitors at the same time to determine which version leaves the maximum impact and drive business metrics

## Context

Facebook recently introduced a new type of bidding, average bidding, as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding. The system works in such a way that whoever pays more, its advertisement is shown to users more.

We can say that; show this ad but I will pay maximum 10 USD or 6 USD on average per impression. If someone else pays maximum of 9 USD or an average of 5 USD to show their ads to the target customer, our ad will be shown to the user, because of the our higher offer.

In this dataset you can find the analysis result of comparison of these two product regarding observations in last 40 days
